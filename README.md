# Callandor

Callandor is a translation and note application.

I had some problem while learning english. I lost my words, I noted same word many times and I have bad handwriting. Many issues like that. I was have to solve this problems so I designed the Callandor.

On "Add" panel, Callandor translates word that you don't know meaning to your native language (by Cambridge dictionary). Then, you can note this according want your want meaning. If this word is been added before, Callandor sends a alert to you and update "Forgot Date" table. If the word is been in "Learned Words", Callandor moves this word to "Words" table and you get alert.

On "Show" panel, you can see all of the words. You can update, delete, move them. You can move to "Learned Words" the word that you think learn. When you try to save this word again, it come back to "Words" table. Becarefull. You can see how many time you forgot which word in "Forgotten Date" table. 

On "Daily" panel, Callandor gives you daily five words. This may work on the beginning of learning. 

On "Settings" panel, There are language and database options. Callandor starts with SQLite database and Turkish language options by defaultly. There are Turkish, German, Italian and French language options for now. Also, it can work with MySQL, you can change.

Callandor.jar can be run directly on computer the have JDK 11 and higher. Also, I add libraries my used for Netbeans.
